# DSA Lab Web

This is the front-end dashboard built with **Vite + React + TypeScript**.

## Status

Currently contains **only** placeholder documentation. No JSX, no route handlers, no application logic.

Post-kickoff, this will be a Vite React app styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

## Structure

- `src/components/*.md` - Component intent and prop shapes
- `src/pages/*.md` - Page narratives and data requirements
- `src/lib/*.md` - API client and Realtime connection patterns
- `src/hooks/*.md` - Custom hook descriptions
- `public/` - Static assets (empty for now)

## Planned Stack

- Vite
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Supabase client (for Realtime subscriptions)

## Development (Post-Kickoff)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
