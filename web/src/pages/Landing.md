## Components Used

- Navbar:
(from left to right)
    - Logo placeholder
    - About
    - Challenges
on the right, two buttons: 
    - Log in
    - Start Learning
- Hero
    - (left centered) Include in bold "Stop memorizing, start learning."
    - on the right of the text, it should be a carousel of the differnet challenges offered (build a stack, build a linked list, etc. )
    - Under the bold hero text, it should say learn data structures and algorithms by building them from scratch.
    - Primary CTA button: "Start Learning" → navigates to /challenges

- Why Section (Problem/Solution - Keep concise!)
    In hero text: Missing the fundamentals? We've got your back.
    - (in subheading text)"With AI, it's tempting to skip the basics. But if you never built a stack, queue, or hash map yourself, you cap your ceiling. 
    - Visual: Simple two-column layout or card design. 

- How It Works (Quick 3-4 step visual)
    1. Pick a challenge (Stack, Queue, Binary Search, Min-Heap)
    2. Get a private GitHub repo with starter code and tests
    3. Clone it, code locally, run `dsa test` to check your work
    4. Submit and watch your dashboard update in real-time
    - Visual: Numbered steps with icons or simple illustrations

- Key Differentiators (3 feature cards)
    - Real Repos: "Get actual GitHub repos you can build on, not browser editors"
    - CLI-First: "Work in your terminal like a real engineer"
    - Build Systems: "Structured projects with tests, not isolated puzzles"

- Final CTA Section
    - Large "Start Your First Challenge" button
    - Secondary link: "Learn More" → navigates to /about
