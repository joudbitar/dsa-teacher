You are testing the DSA Lab to ensure our test independence fixes work correctly.

RUN THIS SCRIPT:
```bash
cd /Users/joudbitar/Code/Projects/hackathon
chmod +x test-modules.sh
./test-modules.sh
```

The script will:
1. Test 6 module/language combinations
2. Create projects via API
3. Clone repos
4. Verify Challenge 1 passes with starter code
5. Verify Challenge 2 doesn't require size()
6. Report results

YOUR JOB:
- Run the script
- If any tests fail, investigate why
- Report which specific test files still have size() dependencies
- Suggest fixes if needed

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
```
Testing: queue in java
✅ Challenge 1: PASSED
✅ Challenge 2: No size() dependency

Testing: queue in cpp
✅ Challenge 1: PASSED
✅ Challenge 2: No size() dependency

... etc ...

SUMMARY
Total tests: 6
Passed: 6
Failed: 0
🎉 All tests passed!
```

IF TESTS FAIL:
Look at the error logs in ~/dsa-testing/ and identify:
- Which test file is calling size()
- What line number
- Report back: "Fix needed: template-dsa-{module}-{lang}/tests/Test0X_{name}.{ext} line Y"

That's it. Simple testing, clear reporting.
