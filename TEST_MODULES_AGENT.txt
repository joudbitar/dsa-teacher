Test the DSA Lab system by creating projects and verifying challenges work without size() dependencies.

GOAL: Test problematic module/language combinations to ensure the test independence fixes work correctly.

TEST MATRIX (prioritize these):
1. Queue + Java (most complex compile-time checks)
2. Queue + C++ (template compilation issues)
3. Stack + Go (type system quirks)
4. Min-Heap + Java (complex implementation)
5. Stack + Python (simplest, baseline)
6. Queue + TypeScript (modern JS issues)

FOR EACH TEST:
1. Create project via API
2. Clone repo
3. Run test for Challenge 1 (should pass with minimal code)
4. Run test for Challenge 2 (should NOT require size())
5. Document any failures

WORKFLOW:

```bash
cd ~/dsa-testing
mkdir -p test-results

# Test 1: Queue + Java
curl -X POST https://mwlhxwbkuumjxpnvldli.supabase.co/functions/v1/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: agent-test-$(date +%s)" \
  -d '{"moduleId": "queue", "language": "java"}' > test-results/queue-java.json

REPO_URL=$(jq -r '.githubRepoUrl' test-results/queue-java.json)
git clone $REPO_URL queue-java-test
cd queue-java-test

# Challenge 1 should pass with empty class
dsa test 2>&1 | tee ../test-results/queue-java-challenge1.log

# Submit to unlock Challenge 2
dsa submit

# Add minimal enqueue method (NO size yet!)
cat > src/main/java/Queue.java << 'EOF'
public class Queue<T> {
    public void enqueue(T value) {
        // Empty implementation
    }
}
EOF

# Challenge 2 should NOT fail on missing size()
dsa test 2>&1 | tee ../test-results/queue-java-challenge2.log

cd ..
```

REPEAT for each module/language combo.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Challenge 1 passes with empty/minimal class
- Challenge 2 does NOT mention "cannot find symbol: method size()"
- Tests verify behavior without calling size()

REPORT FORMAT:
For each test, document:
- ✅/❌ Status
- Error messages (if any)
- Which line of test file caused issues
- Whether it's a template problem or system problem

After testing all 6 combinations, create a summary:
```
TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md:
- Total tests: 6
- Passed: X
- Failed: Y
- Issues found: [list specific files that need fixes]
```

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT implement full solutions, only add minimal code to test compile/import issues
- Focus on finding where size() is still being called incorrectly
- Document exact error messages for debugging
- If a test fails, read the test file to see what it's checking

START with Queue + Java since that's the one we were debugging earlier.
