You are verifying the DSA Lab system is 100% stable before frontend integration.

GOAL: Complete comprehensive verification and produce a GO/NO-GO decision.

STEP 1: Run Automated Verification
===================================
```bash
cd /Users/joudbitar/Code/Projects/hackathon
chmod +x pre-frontend-verification.sh
./pre-frontend-verification.sh
```

This script tests:
- API endpoint correctness
- CLI command functionality  
- End-to-end workflows
- Error handling
- Challenge progression

STEP 2: Manual Verification Checklist
======================================

While script runs, manually verify:

1. TEMPLATES ARE CURRENT
   ```bash
   cd /Users/joudbitar/Code/Projects/dsa-templates
   # Check that all templates have the fixed tests (no size() in Challenge 2)
   grep -r "assertDoesNotThrow.*enqueue" template-dsa-queue-*/tests/Test02* | wc -l
   # Should return 6 (one for each language)
   ```

2. GITHUB REPOS ARE UPDATED
   - Visit: https://github.com/dsa-teacher
   - Spot check 3-4 templates
   - Verify Test02_Enqueue.java uses assertDoesNotThrow (not assertEquals with size())
   - Confirm last commit is recent (today's date)

3. DATABASE IS ACCESSIBLE
   ```bash
   # Check Supabase dashboard
   # Verify tables exist: projects, submissions
   # Check recent entries look correct
   ```

4. CLI IS INSTALLED
   ```bash
   which dsa
   dsa --version  # Should show version
   ```

5. API IS RESPONDING
   ```bash
   curl https://mwlhxwbkuumjxpnvldli.supabase.co/functions/v1/modules
   # Should return JSON with modules list
   ```

STEP 3: Analyze Results
========================

Review the verification report:
```bash
cat ~/dsa-verification-*/verification-report.txt
```

Look for:
- SUCCESS RATE: Should be 100%
- FAILED TESTS: Should be 0
- Any error patterns or recurring issues

STEP 4: Spot Check a Real Workflow
===================================

Manually test ONE complete workflow:

```bash
cd ~/dsa-final-check
curl -X POST https://mwlhxwbkuumjxpnvldli.supabase.co/functions/v1/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: manual-verify-$(date +%s)" \
  -d '{"moduleId": "queue", "language": "python"}' > project.json

REPO_URL=$(jq -r '.githubRepoUrl' project.json)
git clone $REPO_URL final-test
cd final-test

# Test Challenge 1
dsa test
# Should PASS

# Submit Challenge 1
dsa submit
# Should unlock Challenge 2

# Check config
cat dsa.config.json
# currentChallengeIndex should be 1

# Implement a minimal enqueue (just to verify system works)
cat > src/queue.py << 'EOF'
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def enqueue(self, value):
        self.items.append(value)
EOF

# Test Challenge 2
dsa test
# Should PASS

# Submit Challenge 2
dsa submit
# Should unlock Challenge 3

# Clean up
cd ../..
rm -rf final-test
```

If this works smoothly with no errors → GOOD SIGN

STEP 5: Check for Known Issues
===============================

Review these files for documented problems:
- PRE_FRONTEND_VERIFICATION.txt (Known Issues section)
- Any *-ERROR.log files in test directories
- GitHub Issues on dsa-teacher repos

STEP 6: Performance Check
==========================

Verify acceptable performance:
- Project creation: < 10 seconds
- Test execution: < 30 seconds
- Submit response: < 5 seconds

If any operation takes > 2x these times, investigate.

STEP 7: Produce GO/NO-GO Report
================================

Create a file: FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_DECISION.md

```markdown
# Frontend Integration Readiness

Date: [DATE]
Reviewer: [NAME]

## Automated Tests
- Total: [N]
- Passed: [N]
- Failed: [N]
- Success Rate: [N]%

## Manual Verification
- [ ] Templates updated on GitHub
- [ ] No size() dependencies in early challenges
- [ ] API responding correctly
- [ ] CLI working properly
- [ ] Database operational
- [ ] Complete workflow tested successfully

## Critical Issues Found
[List any blocking issues, or write "None"]

## Non-Critical Issues
[List any minor issues, or write "None"]

## Performance
- Project creation: [N]s
- Test execution: [N]s  
- API response: [N]s

## Decision: GO / NO-GO

### Justification:
[Explain the decision]

### Required Before Frontend (if NO-GO):
1. [Issue to fix]
2. [Issue to fix]

### Signed Off By:
- Backend: ________________
- Date: ________________
```

SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR "GO"
==========================
✓ Automated tests: 100% pass rate
✓ Manual workflow: Completes without errors
✓ No blocking issues
✓ Performance acceptable
✓ Templates confirmed updated
✓ All 3 critical workflows tested (queue/TS, stack/Java, queue/Python)

If ALL criteria met → GO
If ANY criteria failed → NO-GO, fix and re-verify

REPORT YOUR FINDINGS
====================
After completing all steps, summarize:
1. Test results (pass/fail counts)
2. Any issues discovered
3. GO or NO-GO decision
4. Next actions required
