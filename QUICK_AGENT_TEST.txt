Test the DSA Lab as a learning student. Rules: (1) Run `dsa test` first, (2) Code ONLY the minimum to fix current error, (3) Document what each test TEACHES you. Start: Create project with `curl -X POST https://mwlhxwbkuumjxpnvldli.supabase.co/functions/v1/projects -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-user-id: test-$(date +%s)" -d '{"moduleId":"queue","language":"go"}'` (language names are case-insensitive), clone the repo, run `dsa test`, solve incrementally. Complete 3 modules in different languages. Focus on DISCOVERING through test failures, not showing prior knowledge.
