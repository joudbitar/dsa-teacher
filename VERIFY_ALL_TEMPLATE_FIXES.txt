# DSA Lab Template Fixes Verification Prompt

You are a QA tester verifying that all 24 DSA Lab templates were fixed correctly. All templates were just pushed to GitHub.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Empty Starter Code** → Added complete method signatures with proper error throwing
2. **Hidden Compilation Errors** → Modified C++/Java run.sh to show errors instead of hiding them
3. **Cross-Challenge Dependencies** → Removed tests that call methods from later challenges

## Your Mission

Test **6 different module/language combinations** to verify all fixes work:
- 2× C++ or Java (to verify compilation error visibility)
- 2× Any other languages
- 2× Different modules

**Recommended combinations**:
1. Queue + C++ (tests starter code + compilation errors + test independence)
2. Stack + Java (tests cross-challenge dependency fixes)
3. Min-Heap + Go (tests starter code + test independence)
4. Binary-Search + Python (tests starter code)
5. Queue + TypeScript (tests starter code + test independence)
6. Stack + JavaScript (tests starter code)

## Testing Protocol

For EACH combination, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Project
```bash
cd ~/dsa-testing
PROJECT_ID=$(date +%s)
curl -X POST https://mwlhxwbkuumjxpnvldli.supabase.co/functions/v1/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: verify-fixes-$PROJECT_ID" \
  -d '{"moduleId": "MODULE_HERE", "language": "LANGUAGE_HERE"}' | jq . > project-$PROJECT_ID.json

# Extract repo URL
REPO_URL=$(jq -r '.githubRepoUrl' project-$PROJECT_ID.json)
echo "Repo: $REPO_URL"
```

### Step 2: Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone $REPO_URL
cd $(basename $REPO_URL)

# Install dependencies based on language
# TypeScript/JavaScript: npm install
# Python: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Java: mvn clean install
# Go: go mod download
# C++: (no install needed)
```

### Step 3: Verify Starter Code
Check the main source file and verify:
- ✅ Class/function is defined (not empty)
- ✅ All methods have signatures
- ✅ Methods throw errors (not just empty bodies)
- ✅ TODO comments are present

**Example checks**:
```bash
# View the starter code
cat src/queue.ts  # or appropriate file for your language

# Should see something like:
# - Constructor that throws error
# - All methods defined with throw statements
# - TODO comments for each challenge
```

### Step 4: Test Challenge 1 (Verify No Compilation Errors Shown)
```bash
# Try to run tests WITHOUT modifying code
dsa test
```

**Expected for C++/Java**: Should see **compilation errors** (not silent failure)
**Expected for others**: Should see clear test failures (not cryptic errors)

**Document**:
- Did compilation errors appear? (C++/Java only)
- Were error messages helpful?

### Step 5: Fix Challenge 1
Implement ONLY what Challenge 1 requires (usually: create class/initialize fields)

```bash
# Example for Queue + TypeScript:
# Edit src/queue.ts - replace constructor to initialize empty array
# Keep all other methods throwing errors

dsa test
```

**Expected**: Challenge 1 passes, others fail cleanly

### Step 6: Test Challenge 2 (Verify Test Independence)
Implement ONLY Challenge 2 method (e.g., enqueue, push, insert)

```bash
# Example: implement enqueue() but leave all other methods throwing errors
dsa test
```

**Critical Check**: Does Challenge 2 test pass WITHOUT implementing size(), peek(), etc.?

**Expected**: 
- ✅ Challenge 2 passes
- ✅ No errors about "size is not defined" or similar
- ✅ Later challenges fail cleanly (locked or not yet implemented)

### Step 7: Submit and Verify
```bash
dsa submit
```

**Expected**: Challenge 2 unlocks, progress updates

### Step 8: Clean Up
```bash
cd ~/dsa-testing
rm -rf $(basename $REPO_URL)
```

## Verification Checklist

For each of the 6 test runs, document:

### Starter Code ✓/✗
- [ ] Files are not empty
- [ ] All method signatures present
- [ ] Methods throw proper errors
- [ ] TODO comments guide students

### Compilation Errors ✓/✗ (C++/Java only)
- [ ] Compilation errors are SHOWN (not hidden)
- [ ] Error messages are readable
- [ ] Students can debug their syntax errors

### Test Independence ✓/✗
- [ ] Challenge 1 passes with minimal implementation
- [ ] Challenge 2 passes WITHOUT implementing later methods
- [ ] No "size() is not defined" type errors
- [ ] No cross-challenge dependencies

### CLI Functionality ✓/✗
- [ ] `dsa test` runs successfully
- [ ] Test output is clear and helpful
- [ ] `dsa submit` works correctly
- [ ] Progress tracking updates

## Output Format

Create a markdown report with this structure:

```markdown

## Test Results

### Test 1: [Module] + [Language]
**Status**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

**Starter Code**: ✅/❌
- Notes: [observations]

**Compilation Errors** (C++/Java): ✅/❌/N/A
- Notes: [what errors appeared, were they helpful?]

**Test Independence**: ✅/❌
- Challenge 1: [result]
- Challenge 2: [result]
- Notes: [any dependencies found?]

**CLI**: ✅/❌
- Notes: [any issues?]

[Repeat for all 6 tests]

## Summary
- **Total Passed**: X/6
- **Critical Issues**: [list any]
- **Minor Issues**: [list any]
- **Recommendation**: READY FOR PRODUCTION / NEEDS FIXES

## Issues Found
[If any issues, list them here with details]
```

## Expected Results

If all fixes are working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ **24/24** starter code files properly populated
- ✅ **8/8** C++/Java templates show compilation errors
- ✅ **24/24** Challenge 2 tests pass without size/peek dependencies
- ✅ **6/6** test runs complete successfully

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't skip any steps
- ❌ Don't implement all methods at once (defeats the purpose)
- ❌ Don't test the same language twice unless testing different aspects
- ❌ Don't assume something works without verifying

## Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Empty starter files** - Student has no starting point
2. **Silent compilation failures** - Student can't see errors
3. **"Size is not defined"** in Challenge 2 tests - Cross-challenge dependency
4. **Test runner crashes** - Bad test infrastructure
5. **All tests run at once** - Progressive unlocking broken

## Time Estimate

- Each test run: 5-10 minutes
- Total: 30-60 minutes for all 6 tests
- Report writing: 10-15 minutes

## Success Criteria

This verification PASSES if:
- ✅ At least 5/6 combinations work perfectly
- ✅ No critical issues (empty files, hidden errors, cross-dependencies)
- ✅ Any minor issues are cosmetic/non-blocking

## Notes

- **GitHub Cache**: Templates were just pushed, so GitHub might still be propagating. If you see old code, wait 5 minutes and try again.
- **Test Early**: Start with one C++ and one Java test to verify the run.sh fixes
- **Document Everything**: Even small observations might reveal patterns

## After Testing

1. Save your report as `TEMPLATE_FIX_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`
2. If any issues found, list them clearly with reproduction steps
3. If all passed, confirm system is ready for students

Good luck! 🚀
