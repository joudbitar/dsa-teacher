PRE-FRONTEND INTEGRATION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
===============================================

Complete this verification before frontend integration to ensure 100% stability.

PHASE 1: API ENDPOINT TESTING
==============================

Test all API endpoints with various inputs:

1. POST /functions/v1/projects
   - ✓ Valid module/language combinations
   - ✓ Invalid moduleId (should error gracefully)
   - ✓ Invalid language (should error gracefully)
   - ✓ Missing user-id header
   - ✓ Concurrent requests (rate limiting)
   - ✓ All 24 module/language combos (4 modules × 6 languages)

2. GET /functions/v1/projects/:id
   - ✓ Valid project ID
   - ✓ Invalid project ID (404)
   - ✓ Project status progression (in_progress → completed)

3. POST /functions/v1/submissions
   - ✓ Valid submission with passing tests
   - ✓ Valid submission with failing tests
   - ✓ Invalid project token
   - ✓ Challenge progression (unlocking next challenge)
   - ✓ Completion detection (all challenges passed)

PHASE 2: CLI COMMAND TESTING
=============================

Test all CLI commands in real projects:

1. dsa test
   - ✓ Run on fresh project (Challenge 1)
   - ✓ Run with passing code
   - ✓ Run with failing code
   - ✓ Run with compilation errors
   - ✓ Locked challenges stay locked
   - ✓ Progress bar updates correctly

2. dsa submit
   - ✓ Submit passing challenge
   - ✓ Attempt submit with failing tests (should reject)
   - ✓ Challenge unlocking works
   - ✓ Final challenge completion
   - ✓ API communication works
   - ✓ Token authentication

3. Edge Cases
   - ✓ Run outside project directory
   - ✓ Missing dsa.config.json
   - ✓ Corrupted config file
   - ✓ Network timeout handling
   - ✓ Invalid API responses

PHASE 3: END-TO-END WORKFLOW TESTING
=====================================

Complete full student workflows for each language:

Test Matrix (6 critical paths):
1. Queue + TypeScript (modern JS ecosystem)
2. Stack + Java (compilation complexity)
3. Min-Heap + Python (dynamic typing)
4. Queue + Go (type system quirks)
5. Stack + C++ (build system)
6. Binary-Search + JavaScript (simple baseline)

For EACH combination:
- ✓ Create project via API
- ✓ Clone repo successfully
- ✓ Install dependencies (npm/mvn/pip/go)
- ✓ Run Challenge 1 → passes with starter
- ✓ Submit Challenge 1 → unlocks Challenge 2
- ✓ Implement Challenge 2 → tests pass
- ✓ Submit Challenge 2 → unlocks Challenge 3
- ✓ Continue through ALL challenges
- ✓ Final submit → project marked complete
- ✓ Verify database state is correct

PHASE 4: DATA INTEGRITY TESTING
================================

Verify database operations:

1. Project Creation
   - ✓ Projects table records created
   - ✓ Unique IDs generated
   - ✓ Timestamps correct
   - ✓ Status tracking works

2. Submissions
   - ✓ Submissions table records created
   - ✓ Test results stored correctly
   - ✓ Progress tracking accurate
   - ✓ Challenge unlock logic correct

3. Query Operations
   - ✓ Get project by ID
   - ✓ Get submissions by project
   - ✓ User project history
   - ✓ Progress aggregation

PHASE 5: GITHUB INTEGRATION TESTING
====================================

Verify GitHub operations:

1. Repository Creation
   - ✓ Repos created from templates
   - ✓ Correct template used for module/language
   - ✓ Private repos by default
   - ✓ README and files copied correctly

2. Template Quality
   - ✓ All 24 templates have latest fixes
   - ✓ Test independence verified (no size() before size challenge)
   - ✓ Starter code compiles
   - ✓ HINTS.md accurate

3. Authentication
   - ✓ GitHub App credentials valid
   - ✓ Installation ID correct
   - ✓ Private key works
   - ✓ Rate limiting handled

PHASE 6: ERROR HANDLING & EDGE CASES
=====================================

Test failure scenarios:

1. Network Issues
   - ✓ API timeout handling
   - ✓ GitHub API unavailable
   - ✓ Database connection issues
   - ✓ Graceful degradation

2. Invalid Inputs
   - ✓ Malformed JSON
   - ✓ SQL injection attempts
   - ✓ XSS in submission data
   - ✓ Buffer overflow in reports

3. Concurrent Operations
   - ✓ Multiple submissions for same project
   - ✓ Race conditions in challenge unlocking
   - ✓ Simultaneous project creation

4. Resource Limits
   - ✓ Very large test output
   - ✓ Many concurrent users
   - ✓ Database connection pooling

PHASE 7: CROSS-LANGUAGE VERIFICATION
====================================

Ensure consistency across languages:

For EACH language (TS/JS/Py/Java/Go/C++):
- ✓ Test runner works
- ✓ Report format consistent
- ✓ Error messages clear
- ✓ Installation instructions accurate
- ✓ Dependencies installable

PHASE 8: SECURITY AUDIT
========================

1. API Security
   - ✓ JWT verification (if enabled)
   - ✓ Input sanitization
   - ✓ Rate limiting
   - ✓ CORS configured correctly

2. Secrets Management
   - ✓ GitHub private key secure
   - ✓ Database credentials not exposed
   - ✓ API keys not in logs

3. Data Privacy
   - ✓ User isolation
   - ✓ Project token security
   - ✓ No data leakage between users

AUTOMATION SCRIPT
=================

Run comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd /Users/joudbitar/Code/Projects/hackathon
./pre-frontend-verification.sh
```

This will:
1. Test all API endpoints
2. Run CLI through complete workflows
3. Verify database state
4. Check GitHub integration
